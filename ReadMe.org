* Song Sketcher

This project is meant to be a quick-and-dirty recorder for saving song ideas.

My goal was to support basic multitracking as well, but I'm not sure syncing things will be feasible.

I made this because I was disappointed with the apps available on Android for doing similar things.

** Setup

This project requires Python 3.

*** 1. Install ~tornado~

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  pip3 install tornado
#+END_SRC

*** 2. Generate SSL keys

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout certificates/server_jupyter_based.crt.key -out certificates/server_jupyter_based.crt.pem
#+END_SRC

These are needed because otherwise, Firefox will ask every time whether the site has permission to record with your microphone. This is a problem because everything gets out of sync, and it's annoying.
